# Haunted-House-textRPG-project-Python

This first foray of mine into the territory of code and logical loops
takes the player on a text based adventure situated in a haunted house.
Defeat monsters, loot treasures and collect keys to advance. 

I started to learn programming only very recently but already find myself 
awed by the possibilities. This mini-game seeks to imitate a MUD ("multi-user dungeon")
experience in a single player mode, with full control of the various gameplay elements
in the player's hands.

Newest additions:
- ammunition system (shotgun shells and pistol bullets)
- poisoned condition (tracked along other player statistics)
- rooms with item requirements for progress
- free player movement
