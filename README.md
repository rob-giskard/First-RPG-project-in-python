# Haunted-House-textRPG-project-Python

This first foray of mine into the territory of code and logical loops
takes the player on a text based adventure situated in a haunted house.
Defeat monsters, loot treasures and collect keys to advance. 

I started to learn programming only very recently but already find myself 
awed by the possibilities.
